# TOPSIS Algorithm Implementation in Python

## Overview
This project is a Python implementation of the **TOPSIS** (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) algorithm. TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making method that ranks alternatives based on their geometric distance from the ideal best solution and the ideal worst solution.

This script takes a dataset of alternatives and criteria, processes them using provided weights and impacts, and outputs the ranking and performance scores.

## Prerequisites
To run this script, you need Python installed along with the following libraries:
* pandas
* numpy

You can install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy
